            <li>2 28oz canned San Marzano tomatoes</li>

        <p>For the spaghetti, store bought dried and bronze cut preferably.
            Fresh is okay too, but I find that this recipe works best with dried.

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol class="instruction-steps">
            <li>
                <b>Make the basil oil</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Fill a saucepan with 1 cup <b>olive oil</b>.
                        Combine with 10 smashed and peeled <b>garlic gloves</b>,
                        1/2 teaspoon <b>red pepper flakes</b>,
                        and a handful of the fresh <b>basil</b> (entire stem and leaf)
                        into the saucepan.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Set the heat to medium-low. When the oil begins to boil, simmer for 20 minutes or until garlic has softened and basil is wilted.
                        Remove from heat and allow steeping time while the sauce is prepared.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Aromatics:</b> Slice both onions in half through the root and peel off the outer layer. Add 1/2 stick of unsalted butter and 1 tablespoon of oil to a large pot over medium-high heat.
                <p>
                    <i>Optionally you could brown the butter, but Carmy does not brown it. I think the taste of fresh butter would work better for this dish.</i>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Sear onions:</b> When the butter has melted, Place and sear halved onions inside pot, cut-side down. Let onions sear for 2-3 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
            <li><b>Add tomatoes:</b> After the onions are browned, carefully pour in canned tomatoes. Use a spoon or spatula to mash the tomatoes smaller. When the tomatoes begin to boil, switch heat to low. Season to taste with salt, cover with lid and simmer on low for 20-25mins</li>
            <li>OPTIONAL: when the basil-garlic oil has <b>cooled</b>, pour entire thing in food processor and puree. If you have extracted the basil and garlic correctly, this step is optional; you can just strain the oil.</li>
            <li><b>Combine oil:</b> Add <b>1/2 cup</b> of the finished basil-garlic oil into the simmering tomato sauce. Stir until thoroughly combined. Taste and season one final time for salt and pepper, if the sauce is too acidic, sprinkle a pinch of baking soda.</li>
            <li><b>Serve:</b> toss around 1 pound of al dente spaghetti into the pot and combine with sauce. You can add a little of the pasta cooking water to thicken.</li>
        </ol>
